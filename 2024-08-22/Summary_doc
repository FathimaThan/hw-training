Tools Used:

    Python: For implementing data processing and cleaning logic.
    Jupyter Lab: For developing and testing code.
    Streamlit: For building and deploying the interactive web application.

1.Objective:

    Upload, Clean, and Analyze CSV Data: Build a Streamlit app to handle, clean, and provide statistics for uploaded CSV files.

2.File Upload:

    Widget: Users upload a CSV file using a file uploader widget.

3.Error Handling:

    Handling Parsing Errors: Uses try...except to manage errors during CSV file reading, with options to skip or warn about problematic lines. Ignored rows that has more column values than expected.

4.Data Cleaning:

    Standardization:

5.Data Analysis:

    Statistics:
        Total Rows: Display the total number of rows.
        URL Stats: Show counts of valid, invalid, and duplicate URLs.
        Numeric Summary: Provide descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
        Categorical Summary: Display value counts for categorical columns.

6.Download Option:

    CSV Download: Allow users to download the cleaned dataset as a CSV file.

7.User Interface:

    Streamlit Interface: Use Streamlit widgets to upload files, display data, show statistics, and provide a download link.
